## Implementation

The implementation will follow a phased approach, where each stage builds on the previous one. The goal is to progressively introduce the core mechanics, expand them with advanced features, and refine the experience in the later stages.

### Stage 1: Core Gameplay Systems

#### Step 1.1: Procedural World Generation
- **Goal**: Create the terrain and biomes for the game world, ensuring variability and replayability.
- **How to Do It**:
  - Use a **Perlin noise** or **Simplex noise algorithm** to procedurally generate terrain heightmaps. Unreal Engine’s **Landscape System** can be used to create terrain based on these noise maps.
  - Implement biomes by setting **biome zones** on the noise map (e.g., high elevations generate mountains, low areas generate forests).
  - Add **handcrafted landmarks** like dungeons and ruins using **level streaming** to dynamically load specific map regions.
  - Reference: Unreal’s **Procedural Content Generation (PCG)** framework can assist in defining rules for terrain generation and object placement.

#### Step 1.2: Basic Colony-Building System
- **Goal**: Allow players to place basic buildings and begin colony management.
- **How to Do It**:
  - Implement a **grid-based building placement system** using Unreal Engine’s **Grid Panel** or **Tile Maps**. This ensures building alignment and positioning on a grid.
  - Buildings will have basic functionality, allowing them to house NPCs, store resources, or generate food.
  - Each building should have an **interaction UI** to view its status (e.g., number of NPCs assigned, resources stored).
  - Start with a **limited set of buildings** like houses, farms, and storage units, and ensure that they connect with the resource management system.

#### Step 1.3: Basic NPC Management
- **Goal**: Implement simple NPC tasks like resource gathering and construction.
- **How to Do It**:
  - NPCs will be managed using Unreal Engine’s **AI Behavior Trees**. A behavior tree can define basic tasks such as:
    - **Task 1**: Gather resources (wood, stone, food).
    - **Task 2**: Build structures (once the player places a blueprint).
  - Use Unreal’s **NavMesh** system to allow NPCs to navigate the world and reach resource nodes or building sites.
  - Introduce a **task management system**, where the player can assign NPCs to different roles such as builders or gatherers.

### Stage 2: Advanced Colony Features

#### Step 2.1: Building Tier Upgrades
- **Goal**: Implement building upgrades that increase capacity, functionality, and unlock new features.
- **How to Do It**:
  - Define each building in three tiers. For each tier, create **new building meshes** and functionality scripts. These scripts will expand a building’s functionality, e.g., upgrading a farm allows more NPCs to work the farm or boosts production.
  - Use Unreal Engine’s **Blueprint Classes** to manage building upgrades. Each tier is a different class that can be swapped out when an upgrade is initiated.
  - Use a **UI upgrade menu** where the player can spend resources to upgrade buildings.

#### Step 2.2: NPC Traits and Abilities
- **Goal**: Add NPC-specific traits and abilities that influence task performance and can be upgraded over time.
- **How to Do It**:
  - Each NPC will have **traits** stored as variables in their character class (e.g., “lazy” might reduce work speed by 10%, “brave” might improve combat performance).
  - Use **progression mechanics** where NPCs gain experience as they work. Experience points (XP) should be gained for completing tasks, and certain XP thresholds will trigger **trait upgrades** (e.g., upgrading from “novice builder” to “master builder”).
  - Develop a **trait progression UI** so players can see their NPCs’ stats and manage upgrades.

#### Step 2.3: Advanced Crafting and Production Chains
- **Goal**: Implement more complex crafting systems with multi-stage production.
- **How to Do It**:
  - Set up production chains where resources pass through multiple stages (e.g., logs → planks → furniture).
  - Use **data-driven development** in Unreal by creating a **Crafting Data Table** that holds crafting recipes and dependencies.
  - NPCs assigned to crafting roles should follow a workflow where they take materials from storage, process them into intermediate products, and return them to the warehouse for later use.

### Stage 3: Combat and Defense

#### Step 3.1: Player and NPC Combat Systems
- **Goal**: Develop combat mechanics for both the player and NPCs.
- **How to Do It**:
  - Implement the **player combat system** using Unreal Engine’s **Character Movement** and **AnimBlueprints**. Use existing weapons (swords, bows) and implement **combat animations**.
  - NPCs will have combat behavior controlled via **AI Behavior Trees**, which define how they attack enemies, retreat when injured, or defend the colony during a siege.
  - Create a **combat AI system** that handles enemy attacks on the colony. Use **Unreal’s AI Perception System** to allow NPCs to detect and respond to threats.

#### Step 3.2: Siege Defense Mechanics
- **Goal**: Implement sieges where the colony is attacked, and the player must fortify defenses.
- **How to Do It**:
  - Add **fortifications** like walls and watchtowers as buildable structures. These should provide bonuses to NPC defenders (e.g., archers in towers gain increased range).
  - Develop a **siege event system** where waves of enemies attack the colony. Each wave increases in difficulty based on the colony's size and wealth.
  - Use Unreal’s **Destructible Meshes** for walls and buildings so that structures can be damaged during raids.

#### Step 3.3: Boss Fights and Dungeon Raids
- **Goal**: Create boss fights and dungeons that require NPC support.
- **How to Do It**:
  - Create **boss AI systems** using advanced **AI Behavior Trees** to make boss enemies more strategic (e.g., bosses might target high-value NPCs or buildings).
  - Implement dungeons with **procedurally generated layouts**, and make these rare but rewarding.
  - Develop NPC **dungeon roles** where NPCs can either support the player in dungeon raids or attempt them alone once they have high enough skills.

### Stage 4: Story and Quest Systems

#### Step 4.1: Building Exploration Questline
- **Goal**: Introduce an optional questline that educates the player about building functions.
- **How to Do It**:
  - Use Unreal’s **Quest System Framework** or develop a custom system that provides quests based on the player’s progress. For example, when the player builds a farm, they receive a quest that explains how to upgrade it to Tier 2.
  - Quests should offer small rewards, such as unlocking new blueprints or boosting NPC productivity.

#### Step 4.2: Main Storyline and Side Quests
- **Goal**: Implement the main questline and optional side quests tied to exploration and colony management.
- **How to Do It**:
  - Create a series of **quest NPCs** who provide missions related to the colony’s growth or faction interactions. Quests should be dynamic and offer various paths to completion.
  - Ensure quests can progress dynamically based on player actions and decisions.

### Stage 5: Polish and Refinement

#### Step 5.1: Final UI and Gameplay Polishing
- **Goal**: Improve the user experience by refining UI elements for managing colonies, NPCs, and quests.
- **How to Do It**:
  - Use Unreal’s **UMG (Unreal Motion Graphics)** UI Designer to create a clear and intuitive interface for managing colonies, resources, and NPC stats.
  - Implement **visual feedback systems** such as notification pop-ups for events (e.g., when a siege begins or a quest is completed).

#### Step 5.2: Performance Optimization
- **Goal**: Ensure the game runs smoothly across different hardware configurations.
- **How to Do It**:
  - Use Unreal’s **Level of Detail (LOD) system** for buildings and NPCs, reducing complexity when objects are viewed from a distance.
  - Optimize AI performance using **AI LOD** to scale down NPC decision-making processes when not in view.
  - Optimize lighting and post-processing effects to maintain frame rate consistency, especially during large combat scenes.

#### Step 5.3: Final Testing and Bug Fixing
- **Goal**: Test all systems for bugs, glitches, and performance issues.
- **How to Do It**:
  - Conduct multiple rounds of playtesting, focusing on potential edge cases (e.g., NPCs getting stuck, resource management imbalances).
  - Use Unreal’s **Profiling Tools** to find areas of the game that need performance improvements, such as excessive CPU/GPU load during sieges or combat.
